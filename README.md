# am-packbuild

Archivematica package building scripts.

Usage example:

For snapshot package:

    ./packbuild.py -r am -v 1.3.1 -c dev/issue-7239-contentdm-metadata-dip -p archivematica/daily -k 7F0699A0

For release package (include -b flag):

    ./packbuild.py -r ss -v 0.6.1 -c stable/0.6.x -p archivematica/packbuild-test -k 7F0699A0 -b 1

If the -p option is not present, the binary packages will be built locally.

### RPM

The `rpm/` directory contains the files that we use to build our RPM packages.
Use the Makefiles to build the packages. You need Docker installed and running
but it works if the Docker daemon is running a remote machine.

The `rpm-testing` directory contains our Vagrant environment to test the RPM
packages.
